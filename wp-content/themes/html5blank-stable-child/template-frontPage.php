					<h2 class=indentThree>Our Mission</h2>
					<p class="pSpace">Heart of Hanford is the public face of RDH(Restore Downtown Hanford), a non-profit organization built to fit the unique needs Downtown Hanford faces in these times of corporate abundance, fluxing economy, and ever-changing times. 
					Downtown Hanford, over the years, has seen a severe decline in local businesses due, among other factors, to lack of incentives for new business, sparse downtown apartment space, and aggressive corporate development across own. The before listed have resulted in young people leaving town in droves, affecting a creatively-stagnant environment. It is the goal of RDH to discover and implement innovative ways of returning Downtown Hanford to a vibrant and enjoyable resting-state, where our young and our brilliant wish to build a life for themselves and their families. Downtowns bring communities together in a world that's drifting apart.If you would like to get involved, or would just like more information, reach out!

They occupied areas along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as sloughs), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.[9] Therefore, the areas along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.

					<p class="articlepSpace">Every  3rd Tuesday of each month. Itâ€™s one of the most active and successful programs organized by Hanfords. Art lovers and enthusiasts from all walks of life flock downtown Hanford and the Tower District on the first Thursday of each month, and the rest of ArtHop venues in the Hanford metro areas on third Thursdays, to meet and greet with the artists and enjoy the reception and music. Museums, studios, galleries and other venues open their exhibitions to the public at 5:00 p.m. and run the free event until 8:00 p.m. ArtHop has received a remarkable response from the Hanford community. Over 50 participating artist studios, galleries, museums, and other venues exhibit art and artists reception during ArtHop, and it has become both a cultural and special event for the community with a great deal of media coverage.<a href="/">Read More</a>
